# Falafel
1) Create a counter for each type of item sold (Falafels, Sodas, Extras) 2) When the ‘T’ key is pressed for the total, display the count and subtotal for each item, the subtotal for all items, compute tax at 8.7%, display the amount of tax, and the final total for all items plus the tax. Each display should contain two digits past the decimal point.
